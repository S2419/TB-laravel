            <p>  Dear readers, the purpose of this is to start helping to make change for many men. 2019, in the western world suicide rates are <strong> 3-4 times more likely in men than woman </strong>. Us men are struggling and there hasn't been enough effort for us to improve this. I have therefore created this as a way for men to come together to improve, grow and live a purposeful life.<p>
            <p>This is none of that red pill, blue pill or whatever etc. I'd like to emphasise <strong>this is not a pro-men movement whatsoever</strong>. This is the brotherhood. To start of, I'll give a little anecdote of my personal battle. I have suffered with depression and anxiety for a while now. Anxiety for me started at a young age. The panic attacks kicked in from 11 and that was just the beginning. This affected me in school and other areas of my life.<p>
            <p>Soon after(around 15), low-self esteem and confidence issues kicked in, low moods then hit (I wouldn't know for many years later that this was depression). University was a struggle, I had to miss a few things which really ramped up my suicidal thoughts and loneliness, I started looking for escapes in the wrong places. I finally decided to get help in my last year of university, being put on anti-depressants and seeing a counsellor frequently.</p>
            <p>This is just my story, I skipped over a huge amount, it's only a summary. Many men go through several issues and never talk about it and this has led to a huge amount taking their lives. The other main purpose is to pass wisdom amongst each other, in all aspects from how to get a job, progressing in your career/education and focusing on your purpose in life. <p>
            <p> Feel free to post whatever you're feeling, going through and what areas you want help in as this is a community. We are a collective and need to help each other to inspire a new generation of men to change their lives, not only for themselves but for the people around them and the world for the better. <strong>We are the Brotherhood</strong>.</p>

                <strong> The Rules </strong>


            <p><strong>Pretty plain and simple, a 5 year old could follow:</strong></p>

            <p> 1. Nothing offensive, we have to better than that.</p>
            <p> 2. We support men through all aspects life, so this means don't push the agenda that men are more superior. </p>
            <p> 3. Show respect.</p>
